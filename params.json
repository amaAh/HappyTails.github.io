We provide a variety of pet-centric services that include :\r\n\r\n** Walking\r\n\r\n** Light Grooming\r\n\r\n** Playdates (*)\r\n\r\n** Adventures (*)\r\n\r\n      (*) By Appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Community Oriented\r\nI've lived in the Capitol Hill area for nearly 15 years and know all the best parks and trails in our collective neighborhoods. HappyTrails is also a [Capitol Hill Community](https://happytails.github.io) member. In short CHC members loosely adhere to some pragmatic, self sustaining business practices that work as partial antithesis to the gentrification occurring on the hill. (My site was built by members with open source software and is hosted on an open source network.)\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"UA-67212949-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
